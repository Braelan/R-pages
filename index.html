        Colon adenocarcinoma tissue mean gene expession is on the y axis.
        Normal tissue mean gene expression is on the x axis.
        The line of slope 1 represents equal expression in normal and cancer tissue <br><br>
        Observations:
        a) At the green arrow, there is a cluster of genes expressing more prevalently in normal tissue.
          - this is likely smooth muscle tissue that was taken along with normal samples, and not with carcinoma biopsies(1)
        b) There are several outlier genes to look at. <br><br>
        The data is from <a href="http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/oncology/">http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/oncology/</a>
        <br><br>The R script to generate the plot is my original work, available <a href="https://github.com/Braelan/R-Scripts/blob/master/R-scripts/ggplot/carcinoma.R">here</a>.<br><br>

     This is  a map from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/captcalculator/sf-crime/function-to-map-any-crime">Troy Waltersâ€™ R script</a>.
     It uses OpenStreet Maps and SF Open data.  I made modifications so that it
     shows unresolved theft as pale blue and arrests as red overlaid on a map of the Bay Area.
     Thousands of unresolved thefts merges into a pale blue sea with specks of arrest.

    This is a wordcloud of 500 medical wikipedia articles.  Why you ask?
    It gives a visual demonstration of a midway step in building a Naive Bayes
    classifier that predicts if an article is disease related.<br><br>
    Eventually the classifier was 91% sensitive in predicting article type. <br><br>
    Observations:
    a) lots of medical terms (suffer, caus, attack, etc)
    b) the cleaning algorithm didn't catch and magnify suffixes that are often important
      (in fact it cut them off) and unexpectedly magnified several terms.
    The data is from a 20n challenge problem.</a>

    Directions for this graph are in Chptr. 15 of R in a Nutshell.  Here,
    the cost of treating heart failure is plotted against the number of cases
    that a given hospital takes per year.  Complications and comorbidities are
    color coded.
    Costs at some facilities can quadruple the baseline for heart failure once complications and comorbidities come into play.
   The data set is from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/">data.medicare.gov</a>.

  This is a graph of titanic survivors. 0's perished and 1's survived<br><br>
  Newborns to five year olds faired the best, along with 30-35 year olds.  Maybe these were families.  Passengers in their late teens and twenties faired poorly.  Were they in a part of the ship that sunk quickly?
  or just more selfless?   The oldest age group had the worst survival rate.
  This graph was adopted from a tutorial at  <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/course/kaggle-competitions">dataquest</a> with a dataset linked from kaggle.com.
